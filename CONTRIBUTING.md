# Contribution Guidelines

Follow the generic guidelines for contributions to awesome lists described [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md).

When adding a new playgound, please make sure that:

* The playground you are adding works with the last publicly available version of XCode, if it does not consider submitting a pull request to the playground project to fix it
* It fits the category you are adding it to, if it does not feel free to propose a new category.
* If the playground is not available as a Github repository but as a zip and originates from an article that explains the content, link the article instead.

Thank you for contributing to this list.
